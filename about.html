                God <span class="highlight">divinely</span> placed students from <span class="highlight">all over the world</span> at my doorstep. And, <span class="highlight">only by His grace</span>, I have engaged in <span class="highlight">Gospel-centered</span> conversations with these friends of mine. Over time, God put the <span class="highlight">people of Japan</span> on my heart. I asked my Japanese friend a <span class="highlight">simple question</span>, “Do you believe in God?” and she responded with, “Hm, <span class="highlight">I have never thought about a god before</span>. I’m not sure.” I was rocked to my <span class="highlight">core</span>.

                How can someone live for <span class="highlight">twenty years</span> and <span class="highlight">never</span> ponder the <span class="highlight">existence of God</span>? Amidst my shock, my other friend picked up my <span class="highlight">Bible</span> and asked, “Woah, what’s this weirdly big book?” <span class="highlight">That night</span>, I whipped out my laptop and began to research what <span class="highlight">Christianity looks like in Japan</span>. My jaw dropped as I read the statistic stating that <span class="highlight">0.8% of Japan’s population</span> is a <span class="highlight">professing Christian</span>. That’s not even <span class="highlight">1%</span>! In an instant, I went from someone who had <span class="highlight">never</span> considered mission work to someone who wanted <span class="highlight">nothing else</span>.
            </p>

            <br><br>

                <p>I mentioned my <span class="highlight">crazy idea</span> to a mentor of mine, and I was directed to <span class="highlight">Mission to the World</span>. God’s <span class="highlight">sovereignty</span> blows me away sometimes. One thing led to another, and I was on my way to <span class="highlight">Haneda Airport in Tokyo</span> in the beginning of the summer of 2023.</p>

                <p>I spent <span class="highlight">three months</span> working with <span class="highlight">Grace City Church</span> in the heart of Tokyo playing piano, guitar, cajon, and (to my surprise) <span class="highlight">singing in Japanese</span>. Outside of church, I worked with <span class="highlight">Community Arts Tokyo</span> to engage with Japanese people through the arts and point them to a <span class="highlight">Greater Artist</span>. God allowed me to witness the church gain a <span class="highlight">new sister</span>, and that sister happened to be an <span class="highlight">amazing new friend</span>.</p>


            <br><br>

                <p>I felt like God was <span class="highlight">pulling on my heart</span> to pursue <span class="highlight">international missions</span>, and now, I know it is what He has in store for me. I can't wait for <span class="highlight">round 2</span> this summer.</p>
